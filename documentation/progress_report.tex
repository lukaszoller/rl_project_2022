\section{Summary}
In this progress report we shortly explain what we have done until now, especially: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the environment
	\item the algorithms we use
	\item next steps.
\end{itemize}

\section{Environment}
The environment has been programmed from scratch. We didn't deviate from the original plan, which was:


\begin{quote}
Our environment represents a quadratic sea map where a pirate (the agent) wants to rob and destroy merchant ships. Each merchant ship will return a positive reward. If the agent robs all merchant ships, the game will be over. It will also be over after fixed amount of moves. There are also enemy ships moving on the map which the agent has to avoid. If the agent is on the same field as an enemy ship the game will also be over with a negative reward for the agent.\footnote{Cited from the project proposal}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Map}
The followong shows a representation of our map with the following encoding: -1 = outside map, 0 = empty sea, 1 = pirate (our agent), 2 = merchant ship, 3 = pirate ship.

\begin{verbatim}
 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
 -1 -1  1  0  0  0  3 -1 -1
 -1 -1  0  0  0  2  0 -1 -1
 -1 -1  0  0  0  0  2 -1 -1
 -1 -1  0  0  3  0  0 -1 -1
 -1 -1  0  0  0  0  0 -1 -1
 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{State}
The agent \say{perceives} the environment which lies inside a certain distance around him. If the agent has a visibility distance of 2, with the above example map he see the following:
 \begin{verbatim}
 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 
 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 
 -1 -1  1  0  0 
 -1 -1  0  0  0  
 -1 -1  0  0  0 
\end{verbatim}
The agent will receive this state as a flattened vector.

\section{Algorithm}
We implemented a Deep Q-Learning Algorithm with experience replay according to \cite{schaul_2016} and \todo{insert source for dq code}... We use a pytorch neural network with three layers... 

\section{Next steps}
At the moment we are progressing according to plan. The next steps will be the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item debugging: Interaction between agent and environment does not work perfectly, movement of non-agent ships does not work perfectly
	\item perhaps we implement the possibility to control the agent choice (Deep Q-Learning or Q-Learning) with the configuration file we use for the parameter settings.

\end{itemize}
